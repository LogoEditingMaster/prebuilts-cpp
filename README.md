# prebuilts-cpp

This package contains a lot of prebuilt C++ libraries for use by Logo Editing Master, compiled for Windows with x64 and AVX2. (no debug and static libraries)
This zip file contains 77 libraries (+single library into one) but each of them may be impossible to link.
These libraries are compiled using MSVC for Windows with appropriate build flags.

You can download the zip file for prebuilt C++ libraries from [releases](https://github.com/LogoEditingMaster/prebuilts-cpp/releases) page here or else from Google Drive here (as if exceeds 25MB for GitHub uploads)
